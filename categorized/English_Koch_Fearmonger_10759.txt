All we need is peace! It’s police who breaks the law #Fergusonremembers ����
Why it’s always black people who turn out to be guilty when police officers shoot them #Fergusonremembers
#FergusonRemembers I don't feel like I'm protected. Nor that I can protect myself and my family

#FergusonRemembers Do cops need another riot? #ChristianTaylor #MikeBrown
We’ve lost another innocent soul. RIP #MikeBrown #fergusonremembers
#FergusonRemembers Innocent black people die and their murderers come out unscratched, where’s justice? #MikeBrown

#fergusonremembers Policeman is a FAGGOT. The guy he attacked is gay. See the difference? #PoliceBrutality
Ferguson police are awful racists #Fergusonremembers
Nine days earlier Christian taylor was talking about dying young. So it happened and no one ‘s guilty #MikeBrown #Fergusonremembers
police brutality is an obvious fact, it’s stupid to deny it #EndpoliceBrutality #Fergusonremembers
Untill killers are free men I’m not loyal to the system that frees them! #MikeBrown #FergusonRemembers
We won’t tolerate racism, let’s unite against it #FergusonRemembers
#fergusonremembers The fact that being killed by police w/o police getting any consequence is a reality for black ppl sends chills to me
#fergusonremembers POLICE is just going wilder. #MikeBrown #Ferguson
another innocent black life taken. #MikeBrown #FergusonRemembers
So, if someone shoots me he commits a crime, if a cop shoots me he prevents one. Double standarts! #MikeBrown #Fergusonremembers
Critical mass. The tipping point. The straw that broke... whatever. Call it what you like, but #FixThepolice #FergusonRemembers
Every time it’s the same, cop shot out of self-defense, your winesses are not credible… Sick of it! #MikeBrown #fergusonremembers
#FergusonRemembers #BlackLivesMatter! Will the racism be ever stopped?
Racism and #policeBrutality in America is rampant. Change must happen! #BlackLivesMatter #Fergusonremembers

Nine days earlier Christian taylor was talking about dying young. So it happened and no one ‘s guilty #MikeBrown #Fergusonremembers
police brutality is an obvious fact, it’s stupid to deny it #EndpoliceBrutality #Fergusonremembers
That is enough. How do they expect us to show our respect for them, when they just are not worthy of it #fergusonremembers

#FergusonRemembers Nothing changed…
#fergusonremembers The fact that being killed by police w/o police getting any consequence is a reality for black ppl sends chills to me
#fergusonremembers POLICE is just going wilder. #MikeBrown #Ferguson
So, if someone shoots me he commits a crime, if a cop shoots me he prevents one. Double standarts! #MikeBrown #Fergusonremembers
Black people in Ferguson often received fines for nothing #fergusonremembers
tons of cops claim of fearing for their life happen way before they are truly in imminent danger time-wise #staywoke #FergusonRemembers
#fergusonremembers We want our streets to be free of intimidation and fear
#Fergusonremembers How could Ferguson police issue fines for nothing?
Every time it’s the same, cop shot out of self-defense, your winesses are not credible… Sick of it! #MikeBrown #fergusonremembers
#FergusonRemembers #BlackLivesMatter! Will the racism be ever stopped?
Racism and #policeBrutality in America is rampant. Change must happen! #BlackLivesMatter #Fergusonremembers
